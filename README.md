# Week 9 - Honeypot

Time spent: **16** hours spent in total

> Objective: Objective: Learn about Network Security by attacking and being attacked at vulnarable networked resources. Multiple Honey Pot VM instances were created to demonstrate it.

## Honeypots Deployed
1. dionaea
2. conpot
3. wordpot
4. snort
5. elastichoney

I deployed the honeypots and left it on for about 8 hours to gather my results.

## Any issues you encountered
The github clone link was broken in the instructions I had to find the right one myself to set up MHN.

## Overview setup
I followed the instructions given for this lab to set up Google Cloud Platform. I created six VMs. One VM for admin control and the other five for deplying the honeypots.

### GCP Setup
1. Follow the instructions given on the lab to set up GCP.
2. I set up 5 Vms for honeypot deployment.
